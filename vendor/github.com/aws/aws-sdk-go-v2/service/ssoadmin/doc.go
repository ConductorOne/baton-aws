// Package ssoadmin provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for
// AWS Single Sign-On Admin.
//
// IAM Identity Center (successor to Single Sign-On) helps you securely create, or
// connect, your workforce identities and manage their access centrally across
// Amazon Web Services accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the
// recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization in Amazon
// Web Services, for organizations of any size and type.
//
// IAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces.
//
// This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which
// could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For
// information about IAM Identity Center features, see the [IAM Identity Center User Guide].
//
// Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users
// and groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with
// principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the [Identity Store API Reference].
//
// Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for
// various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and
// more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM
// Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information
// about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them,
// see [Tools for Amazon Web Services].
